[c/3ABC7A:Description:]
Hey hey, this is a MrPlague's Authentic Races addon, featuring Fallout's most fierce predator.
These might be a bit OP, but honestly, who's gonna judge us?

The sprites/sounds are low-effort. I'm not a great artist, nor a great coder. Credits to the original assets go to MrPlague, the death sound comes from Fallout 4.

Hey, rewrite the guide to publishing mods; there's no option to link to github as described in your guides. If I'm really that stupid, (or if this mod has issues you wanna report), contact me on discord @Apzen#1984

[c/3ABC7A:Updates:]
I recently fixed up some of the poorly written stuff, but there's a couple of things I wanted to write here for posterity.

Update 0.1.1 Changelog:
☢ Added Mod of Redemption interaction (Deathclaws are now immune to radiation!). Note, you don't need Mod of Redemption to play a Deathclaw. This is just a nice bonus if you do.
☢ Reduced the rate of spawns (the thing used in the tooltip mentioning the difficulty is increased if you play deathclaws).
